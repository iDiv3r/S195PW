Later he began to write longer prose works, among which “La vegetariana” (“The vegetarian”) stands out, one of his first books translated into English. The novel, which won the Man Booker International Prize in 2016, tells of a young womans attempt to live a more vegetable existence after suffering macabre nightmares about human cruelty.')}}

        <p>
            {{__('Originally written and published in Korean, “The Vegetarian” was translated by Deborah Smith, then 28 years old. Smith, by her own admission, was “monolingual until she was 21,” only opting for Korean due to a lack of English-Korean translators.')}}

            {{__('But Hans intense and lyrical writing almost acts as a consolation in the face of this historical violence, Palm added. “His prose, very tender and precise, almost becomes a counterpoint to the brutal noise of power,” he said.')}}
